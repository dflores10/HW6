    <h2> Welcome to the NBA Teams Website! </h2>
    <p> This website includes information about all 30 NBA teams. Specifically, we keep track of every team's 
        name, head coach, conference, division, number of wins, number of losses and win-loss percentage 
        for the 2013-2014 season. Our main goal is to keep users up to date with the current standings 
        of each team throughout the season.
